    "\n",

    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The CNN-RNN architecture consists of the resnet pre-trained CNN with the last layer replaced with a fully connected linear layer, which is used as the first input to the RNN. The feature maps from the last convolutional layer contain spatial information of the image. The RNN is made up of LSTM cells, which are good at remembering sequences of words and takes this information to produce a caption. At each time step or new word generated, the new input to the LSTM consists of the previously generated captions. This allows for the hidden state to be updated after every word, and predict the next word based on a probablistic distribution of all words in the vocabulary. This is done by feeding the LSTM outputs to a fully connected linear layer that is the size of the vocabulary. The embedding size of 256 and hidden size of 512 are reasonable in many cases. They should be large enough to have the capacity to learn the complex mapping between image-caption pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The transformation implemented needs to take each image and preprocess it correctly to be able to be input into the pre-trained CNN architecture. Mainly, this includes resizing the images to a square matrix with the values normalized for the model that is then cast to a tensor that can be fed into the encoder. Other parameters to the transform are applied to help the model learn that whether the image is cropped or flipped, it still represents the same picture and contains the same underlying features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** All weights in the decoder and only the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder are trainable parameters. The pre-trained CNN is used as a feature extractor for a given image. The image is fed through the pre-trained CNN up until the last layer where it is then fed through our embedding layer to then be used as input to the decoder RNN. We replace the pre-trained models fully connected layer with our trainable embedding layer because we are not classifying the image, but rather training the network to capture spatial information that can be used to generate captions by being fed into the Decoder RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The optimizer I selected is the Adam optimizer. The architecture in the paper used the Adam optimizer. I also noticed through trial and error that this optimzer brought much better results than other optimizers such as SGD.\n",
